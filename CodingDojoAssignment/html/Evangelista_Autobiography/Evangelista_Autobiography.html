        <span style=" margin-left: 40px;">HelloðŸ‘‹, I am <b>Argel Joseph Rivas Evangelista</b> a career shifter and aspiring software developer who is decisive to create a better future having an awesome job in tech industry.</span>
        </p>
        <p><span style="margin-left: 40px;">I was born and grew up in Quezon City, Philippines.</span> My father was a cook and my mother was a public school teacher. My older sister and I had a decent and a quite comfortable upbringing. We had been raised in a densely populated environment where people only prioritize making their ends meet. Despite our situation, we managed to have a proper education and even attended college. My sister was good at school and got a scholarship from high school to college in one of the prestigious schools here in our country. While I decided not to compete with her since and I was not good academically, I found myself good at practical skills and enjoying sports and playing computer games.
        </p>
        <p>
        <span style="margin-left: 40px;">Since my childhood was on this verge of a new computer era, I have been fascinated and even get addicted to various online computer games</span>. But having limited resources, this hobby was not sustained. In College, I didn't pursue any tech related courses because my parents could not simply provide me with necessary tools like computers that are much needed in those degrees. Instead, I decided to get a bachelor's degree in Psychology and dreamed about being a medical doctor someday and to make this long story short, I haven't finished it yet up to this time. I was compelled to leave college and start working because we were financially constrained. I had to support myself and looked for different jobs that accept college dropouts until sales opened a door for me and became a sales agent and an event organizer. In my sales experience I was able to contribute not only in revenues but in organizational growth and management.

        <p>
        <span style="margin-left: 40px;">Fast-forward, I decided to resign and leave the organization that catered to me since day one of my sales career and tried to become a full time entrepreneur while having a <i><b>raket</b></i> on the side.</span> At first, it goes well but COVID pandemic came in and all of my investments didn't prosper. Through online freelancing, I ran into w                              eb development during my work as sales support and social media platforms and e-commerce manager for an online store. I searched about it and the whatnots of becoming an effective web developer. So here I am, taking the chance to be one of them.
